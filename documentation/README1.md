## 1) Running Via Gradio Web Interface

The Gradio interface can be used to:

- Select the model version
- Select LoRA or full model
- Enter Java/Python code
- Run the extract program
- View UML class diagram
- View OCL specifications

Please follow these instructions:  

#### 1. Connect to the GPU Provider

From your local computer, connect to the remote GPU/HPC server using SSH. For example:

```bash
ssh -m hmac-sha2-512 USERNAME@HPC_HOST
```

Replace:

- USERNAME with your account username on the HPC/GPU provider.
- HPC_HOST with the hostname of the remote HPC/GPU server.

After connecting successfully, you should see a shell prompt on the HPC login node, similar to:

```bash
USERNAME@HPC_LOGIN_NODE:~$
```

For example, if your provider gives you the username `k12345` and the login hostname `hpc.example.org`:

```bash
ssh -m hmac-sha2-512 k12345@hpc.example.org
```

> **Note:** You must have an account and SSH access to the HPC/GPU provider before running this command. The hostname, username, authentication method, and SSH options may differ between providers.

---

#### 2. Go to the Project Directory

Move into the LLM4Models project:

```bash
cd ~/LLM4Models
```

Check that the project is there:

```bash
ls
```

You should see files such as:

```
extract.py
app.py
input/
...
```

You can also check your current directory:

```bash
pwd
```
---

#### 3. Verify the Input File Exists

Check the input file:

```bash
ls -lh input/sample.java
or
ls -lh input/sample.py
```

You can also test:

```bash
cat input/sample.java
or
cat input/sample.py
```

---

#### 4. Ask for GPU from the GPU Provider:
For example, in KCL, we use:

```bash
srun --partition=gpu \
     --gres=gpu:1 \
     --time=04:00:00 \
     --cpus-per-task=4 \
     --mem=32G \
     --pty /bin/bash -l
```
Then you will see:
```bash
srun: job 37241627 has been allocated resources
```
This number is important when we open the Gradio interface. Please keep it.

```bash
nvidia-smi
```
Then:

```bash
module load cuda
```
---

#### 5. Activate the Python Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
. ~/venvs/bin/activate
```

Check Python:

```bash
python --version
```

Check where Python is coming from:

```bash
which python
```

It should point to something similar to:

```
.../venvs/bin/python
```

---

#### 6. Run the Program

Run the Gradio program:

```bash
python app.py
```
---

#### 7. Open a Second CMD Window
Now go to your Windows PC and open a second CMD window, and enter:

```bash
for /f "delims=" %N in ('ssh -m hmac-sha2-512 USER@HPC_HOST "squeue -n JOB_NAME -h -o %%N"') do ssh -m hmac-sha2-512 -N -L LOCAL_PORT:%N:REMOTE_PORT USER@HPC_HOST

or

for /f "delims=" %N in ('ssh -m hmac-sha2-512 USER@HPC_HOST "squeue -j JOB_ID -h -o %%N"') do ssh -m hmac-sha2-512 -N -L LOCAL_PORT:%N:REMOTE_PORT USER@HPC_HOST
```
Where:
 - USER → your HPC username
 - HPC_HOST → your HPC login host
 - JOB_NAME → your Slurm job name
 - LOCAL_PORT → local port, e.g. 7860
 - REMOTE_PORT → application port, e.g. 7860
 - JOB_ID → the Slurm job ID, e.g. 12345678

For example:
```bash
for /f "delims=" %N in ('ssh -m hmac-sha2-512 k12345@hpc.create.kcl.ac.uk "squeue -j Jupyter Lab 12345678 -h -o %%N"') do ssh -m hmac-sha2-512 -N -L 7860:%N:7860 k12345@hpc.create.kcl.ac.uk

or

for /f "delims=" %N in ('ssh -m hmac-sha2-512 k12345@hpc.create.kcl.ac.uk "squeue -j 12345678 -h -o %%N"') do ssh -m hmac-sha2-512 -N -L 7860:%N:7860 k12345@hpc.create.kcl.ac.uk
```
---

#### 8. Windows: Open the Browser

Please leave both windows open, then open your browser and enter:
```bash
http://localhost:7860
```
Your Gradio application should open.
